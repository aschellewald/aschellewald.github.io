			<br><h2>&#x1F4C7; About</h2><hr>
			<p>I'm a mixed-methods researcher working on the topics of esports, gaming, social media, entertainment, and recommender systems. Among other things I try to better understand how people scroll through content feeds or why they watch other people play video games.</p>

			<br><h2>&#x1F393; Education</h2><hr>
			<p>I hold a MSc in Digital Sociology from the University of Edinburgh and am currently completing my PhD at Goldsmiths, University of London. Before that I have studied Communication and Cultural Sutdies at Zeppelin University, as well as at the University of Vienna.</p>

				<summary>Schellewald, A. (in progress). Theorizing ‘personalisation’ as socio-technical configuration.</summary>
				<p class="abstract">Abstract: In both popular and technical discourses recommender systems are usually seen as the dominant driver of what is described as ‘personalisation’ – that can be, for example, a content feed that is specifically tailored to a given user based on their past consumption preferences. Recent research has increasingly foregrounded the active role that users play within such environments of personalisation, focussing for instance on the ways in which self-identities are negotiated or algorithmic biases responded to. This paper contributes to these debates by developing the idea of ‘reading for personalisation’. It argues that users, through the way in which they navigate and ‘read’ algorithmic environments, performatively enact personalisation as an outcome they experience as an environmental property. This performance consists of a habitualised navigation towards content resonating with ideas of one’s self. As such I position the ‘reader’ as a dominant driving force shaping the socio-technical configuration that we understand as ‘personalisation’.</p>

				<summary>Schellewald, A. (2024). Discussing the role of TikTok sharing practices in everyday social life. International Journal of Communication, 18, 909-926.</summary>
				<p class="abstract">Abstract: A crucial element of TikTok consumption is the act of sharing TikTok videos with others, such as friends. In this article, I draw on ethnographic fieldwork with young adult TikTok users based in the United Kingdom to investigate this practice. I show how people use TikTok’s “For You” page as a resource to facilitate social relationships at a distance and in  settings of physical copresence. I highlight how TikTok clips are shared in a phatic manner to activate social relationships, for example, by communicating messages such as “thinking about you” or relating to others by referencing TikTok memes in conversations. Attending to sharing practices, I argue, provides a fruitful way to understand how self-identities and interpersonal relationships are articulated in social media environments increasingly organized around the logic of personalization.<br><br>The full paper is available open access <a href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/20993/4476" target="_blank">here</a></p>

				<summary>Schellewald, A. (2023). Understanding the popularity and affordances of TikTok through user experiences. Media, Culture & Soceity, 45(8), 1568-1582.</summary>
				<p class="abstract">Abstract: In this paper I discuss the affordances and popularity of the short-video app TikTok from an audience studies point of view. I do so by drawing on findings from ethnographic fieldwork with young adult TikTok users based in the United Kingdom that was conducted in 2020 and 2021. I trace how using the app, specifically scrolling through the TikTok For You Page, the app’s algorithmic content feed, became a fixed part of the everyday routines of young adults. I show how TikTok appealed to them as a convenient means of escape and relief that they were unable to find elsewhere during and beyond times of lockdown. Further, I highlight the complex nature of TikTok as an app and the active role that users play in imagining and appropriating the app’s affordances as meaningful parts of their everyday social life. Closing the paper, I reflect on future directions of TikTok scholarship by stressing the importance of situated audience studies.<br><br>The full paper is available open access <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01634437221144562" target="_blank">here</a></p>

				<summary>Schellewald, A. (2022). Theorizing 'stories about algorithms' as a mechanism in the formation and maintenance of algorithmic imaginaries. Social Media + Society, 8(1), 1-10.</summary>
				<p class="abstract">Abstract: In this article I report from an ethnographic investigation into young adult users of the popular short-video app TikTok. More specifically, I discuss their experience of TikTok’s algorithmic content feed, or so-called “For You Page.” Like many other personalized online environments today, the For You Page is marked by the tension of being a mechanism of digital surveillance and affective control, yet also a source of entertainment and pleasure. Focusing on people’s sense-making practices, especially in relation to stories about the TikTok algorithm, the article approaches the discursive repertoire that underpins people’s negotiation of this tension. Doing so, I theorize the role and relevance of “stories about algorithms” within the context of algorithmic imaginaries as activating users in sense-making processes about their algorithmic entanglements.<br><br>The full paper is available open access <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051221077025" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				<summary>Schellewald, A. (2021). Communicative forms on TikTok: Perspectives from digital ethnography. International Journal of Communication, 15, 1437-1457.</summary>
				<p class="abstract">Abstract: TikTok is an app that allows people to create, share, and consume short-video content. Although only available internationally since 2017, it has already been downloaded more than 2 billion times and has around 800 million active users. Public interest in the fleeting and seemingly random video clips that TikTok hosts is high. In fact, it has grown steadily since the time of the Twitter-owned short-video app Vine that ended its service in 2016 with only a quarter of TikTok’s current userbase. However, despite this steady growth in popularity, observations and theorizations of short-video apps like TikTok remain lacking. In this article, I seek to address this lack by critically discussing how to study short-video communications from the bottom up and by presenting the results of an exploratory investigation into TikTok and its communicative forms. Doing so, this article contributes to opening a space for serious engagement with this burgeoning yet understudied element of digital culture in the future.<br><br>The full paper is available open access <a href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/16414" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
